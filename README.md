# JChess
The first major thing I ever programmmed, recently revamped and brought up to my current standards. Its a simple 2 player chess game with saving, and loading functionality. It is programmed in java heavilly utilizing Java Swing. 

Going back and looking over the original code for this project was extremely humbling. I recall thinking it was all pure genius at the time I wrote it, but reading over it almost 2 years later I was tempted to just toss the whole thing out the window and start over (I practically did considering how many lines of code ended up being modified...).  It was a valuable lesson in humility.
